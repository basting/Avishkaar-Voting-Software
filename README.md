# Avishkaar Voting Software
Voting software used for selecting the top 3 ideas submitted in Avishkaar 2010

Screenshots show how the software will look like.

Flow is as below:

1.    User is presented with a login screen to input his ntnet user id.

2.    Once the ntnet user is validated(against valid ntnet user list & against the already voted list), he is presented with the voting screen.

a.    The voting screen will have buttons corresponding to the number of Avishkaar finalists.

b.    Each button will have the details about participants & their ideas.

3.    One user can click three times, allowing him to select Rank 1, Rank 2 & Rank 3. Then he clicks submit. The user vote is submitted to the database.

4.    This completes the voting of one person. Now, the login screen is presented again for the next user voting.
